"""
Demonstrate the use of multiprocessing with PyMuPDF.

Depending on the  number of CPUs, the document is divided in page ranges.
Each range is then worked on by one process.
The type of work would typically be text extraction or page rendering. Each
process must know where to put its results, because this processing pattern
does not include inter-process communication or data sharing.

Compared to sequential processing, speed improvements in range of 100% (ie.
twice as fast) or better can be expected.

    Notes:
        The PyMuPDF document cannot be part of the argument, because that
        cannot be pickled. So we are being passed in just its filename.
        This is no performance issue, because we are a separate process and
        need to open the document anyway.
        Any page-specific function can be processed here - rendering is just
        an example - text extraction might be another.
        The work must however be self-contained: no inter-process communication
        or synchronization is possible with this design.
        Care must also be taken with which parameters are contained in the
        argument, because it will be passed in via pickling by the Pool class.
        So any large objects will increase the overall duration.
