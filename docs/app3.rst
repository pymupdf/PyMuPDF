This section deals with various technical topics, that are not necessarily related to each other.

.. _ImageTransformation:

Image Transformation Matrix
----------------------------
Starting with version 1.18.11, the image transformation matrix is returned by some methods for text and image extraction: :meth:`Page.get_text` and :meth:`Page.get_image_bbox`.

The transformation matrix contains information about how an image was transformed to fit into the rectangle (its "boundary box" = "bbox") on some document page. By inspecting the image's bbox on the page and this matrix, one can determine for example, whether and how the image is displayed scaled or rotated on a page.

The relationship between image dimension and its bbox on a page is the following:

1. Using the original image's width and height,
    - define the image rectangle `imgrect = pymupdf.Rect(0, 0, width, height)`
    - define the "shrink matrix" `shrink = pymupdf.Matrix(1/width, 0, 0, 1/height, 0, 0)`.

2. Transforming the image rectangle with its shrink matrix, will result in the unit rectangle: `imgrect * shrink = pymupdf.Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)`.

3. Using the image **transformation matrix** "transform", the following steps will compute the bbox::

    imgrect = pymupdf.Rect(0, 0, width, height)
    shrink = pymupdf.Matrix(1/width, 0, 0, 1/height, 0, 0)
    bbox = imgrect * shrink * transform

4. Inspecting the matrix product `shrink * transform` will reveal all information about what happened to the image rectangle to make it fit into the bbox on the page: rotation, scaling of its sides and translation of its origin. Let us look at an example:

    >>> imginfo = page.get_images()[0]  # get an image item on a page
    >>> imginfo
    (5, 0, 439, 501, 8, 'DeviceRGB', '', 'fzImg0', 'DCTDecode')
    >>> #------------------------------------------------
    >>> # define image shrink matrix and rectangle
    >>> #------------------------------------------------
    >>> shrink = pymupdf.Matrix(1 / 439, 0, 0, 1 / 501, 0, 0)
    >>> imgrect = pymupdf.Rect(0, 0, 439, 501)
    >>> #------------------------------------------------
    >>> # determine image bbox and transformation matrix:
    >>> #------------------------------------------------
    >>> bbox, transform = page.get_image_bbox("fzImg0", transform=True)
    >>> #------------------------------------------------
    >>> # confirm equality - permitting rounding errors
    >>> #------------------------------------------------
    >>> bbox
    Rect(100.0, 112.37525939941406, 300.0, 287.624755859375)
    >>> imgrect * shrink * transform
    Rect(100.0, 112.375244140625, 300.0, 287.6247253417969)
    >>> #------------------------------------------------
    >>> shrink * transform
    Matrix(0.0, -0.39920157194137573, 0.3992016017436981, 0.0, 100.0, 287.6247253417969)
    >>> #------------------------------------------------
    >>> # the above shows:
    >>> # image sides are scaled by same factor ~0.4,
    >>> # and the image is rotated by 90 degrees clockwise
    >>> # compare this with pymupdf.Matrix(-90) * 0.4
    >>> #------------------------------------------------

.. _Base-14-Fonts:

PDF Base 14 Fonts
---------------------
The following 14 builtin font names **must be supported by every PDF viewer** application. They are available as a dictionary, which maps their full names amd their abbreviations in lower case to the full font basename. Wherever a **fontname** must be provided in PyMuPDF, any **key or value** from the dictionary may be used::

    In [2]: pymupdf.Base14_fontdict
    Out[2]:
    {'courier': 'Courier',
    'courier-oblique': 'Courier-Oblique',
    'courier-bold': 'Courier-Bold',
    'courier-boldoblique': 'Courier-BoldOblique',
    'helvetica': 'Helvetica',
    'helvetica-oblique': 'Helvetica-Oblique',
    'helvetica-bold': 'Helvetica-Bold',
    'helvetica-boldoblique': 'Helvetica-BoldOblique',
    'times-roman': 'Times-Roman',
    'times-italic': 'Times-Italic',
    'times-bold': 'Times-Bold',
    'times-bolditalic': 'Times-BoldItalic',
    'symbol': 'Symbol',
    'zapfdingbats': 'ZapfDingbats',
    'helv': 'Helvetica',
    'heit': 'Helvetica-Oblique',
    'hebo': 'Helvetica-Bold',
    'hebi': 'Helvetica-BoldOblique',
    'cour': 'Courier',
    'coit': 'Courier-Oblique',
    'cobo': 'Courier-Bold',
    'cobi': 'Courier-BoldOblique',
    'tiro': 'Times-Roman',
    'tibo': 'Times-Bold',
    'tiit': 'Times-Italic',
    'tibi': 'Times-BoldItalic',
    'symb': 'Symbol',
    'zadb': 'ZapfDingbats'}

In contrast to their obligation, not all PDF viewers support these fonts correctly and completely -- this is especially true for Symbol and ZapfDingbats. Also, the glyph (visual) images will be specific to every reader.

To see how these fonts can be used -- including the **CJK built-in** fonts -- look at the table in :meth:`Page.insert_font`.

.. _AdobeManual:

Adobe PDF References
---------------------------

This PDF Reference manual published by Adobe is frequently quoted throughout this documentation. It can be viewed and downloaded from `here <https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/standards/pdfstandards/pdf/PDF32000_2008.pdf>`_.

.. note:: For a long time, an older version was also available under `this <http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf>`_ link. It seems to be taken off of the web site in October 2021. Earlier (pre 1.19.*) versions of the PyMuPDF documentation used to refer to this document. We have undertaken an effort to replace referrals to the current specification above.

------------

.. _SequenceTypes:

Using Python Sequences as Arguments in PyMuPDF
------------------------------------------------
When PyMuPDF objects and methods require a Python **list** of numerical values, other Python **sequence types** are also allowed. Python classes are said to implement the **sequence protocol**, if they have a `__getitem__()` method.

This basically means, you can interchangeably use Python *list* or *tuple* or even *array.array*, *numpy.array* and *bytearray* types in these cases.

For example, specifying a sequence `"s"` in any of the following ways

* `s = [1, 2]` -- a list
* `s = (1, 2)` -- a tuple
* `s = array.array("i", (1, 2))` -- an array.array
* `s = numpy.array((1, 2))` -- a numpy array
* `s = bytearray((1, 2))` -- a bytearray

will make it usable in the following example expressions:

* `pymupdf.Point(s)`
* `pymupdf.Point(x, y) + s`
* `doc.select(s)`

Similarly with all geometry objects :ref:`Rect`, :ref:`IRect`, :ref:`Matrix` and :ref:`Point`.

Because all PyMuPDF geometry classes themselves are special cases of sequences, they (with the exception of :ref:`Quad` -- see below) can be freely used where numerical sequences can be used, e.g. as arguments for functions like *list()*, *tuple()*, *array.array()* or *numpy.array()*. Look at the following snippet to see this work.

>>> import pymupdf, array, numpy as np
>>> m = pymupdf.Matrix(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
>>>
>>> list(m)
[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
>>>
>>> tuple(m)
(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0)
>>>
>>> array.array("f", m)
array('f', [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0])
>>>
>>> np.array(m)
array([1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6.])

.. note:: :ref:`Quad` is a Python sequence object as well and has a length of 4. Its items however are :data:`point_like` -- not numbers. Therefore, the above remarks do not apply.

------------

.. _ReferenialIntegrity:

Ensuring Consistency of Important Objects in PyMuPDF
------------------------------------------------------------
PyMuPDF is a Python binding for the C library MuPDF. While a lot of effort has been invested by MuPDF's creators to approximate some sort of an object-oriented behavior, they certainly could not overcome basic shortcomings of the C language in that respect.

Python on the other hand implements the OO-model in a very clean way. The interface code between PyMuPDF and MuPDF consists of two basic files: *pymupdf.py* and *fitz_wrap.c*. They are created by the excellent SWIG tool for each new version.

When you use one of PyMuPDF's objects or methods, this will result in execution of some code in *pymupdf.py*, which in turn will call some C code compiled with *fitz_wrap.c*.

Because SWIG goes a long way to keep the Python and the C level in sync, everything works fine, if a certain set of rules is being strictly followed. For example: **never access** a :ref:`Page` object, after you have closed (or deleted or set to *None*) the owning :ref:`Document`. Or, less obvious: **never access** a page or any of its children (links or annotations) after you have executed one of the document methods *select()*, *delete_page()*, *insert_page()* ... and more.

But just no longer accessing invalidated objects is actually not enough: They should rather be actively deleted entirely, to also free C-level resources (meaning allocated memory).

The reason for these rules lies in the fact that there is a hierarchical 2-level one-to-many relationship between a document and its pages and also between a page and its links / annotations. To maintain a consistent situation, any of the above actions must lead to a complete reset -- in **Python and, synchronously, in C**.

SWIG cannot know about this and consequently does not do it.

The required logic has therefore been built into PyMuPDF itself in the following way.

1. If a page "loses" its owning document or is being deleted itself, all of its currently existing annotations and links will be made unusable in Python, and their C-level counterparts will be deleted and deallocated.

2. If a document is closed (or deleted or set to *None*) or if its structure has changed, then similarly all currently existing pages and their children will be made unusable, and corresponding C-level deletions will take place. "Structure changes" include methods like *select()*, *delePage()*, *insert_page()*, *insert_pdf()* and so on: all of these will result in a cascade of object deletions.

The programmer will normally not realize any of this. If he, however, tries to access invalidated objects, exceptions will be raised.

Invalidated objects cannot be directly deleted as with Python statements like *del page* or *page = None*, etc. Instead, their *__del__* method must be invoked.

All pages, links and annotations have the property *parent*, which points to the owning object. This is the property that can be checked on the application level: if *obj.parent == None* then the object's parent is gone, and any reference to its properties or methods will raise an exception informing about this "orphaned" state.

A sample session:

>>> page = doc[n]
>>> annot = page.first_annot
>>> annot.type                    # everything works fine
[5, 'Circle']
>>> page = None                   # this turns 'annot' into an orphan
>>> annot.type
<... omitted lines ...>
RuntimeError: orphaned object: parent is None
>>>
>>> # same happens, if you do this:
>>> annot = doc[n].first_annot     # deletes the page again immediately!
>>> annot.type                    # so, 'annot' is 'born' orphaned
<... omitted lines ...>
RuntimeError: orphaned object: parent is None

This shows the cascading effect:

>>> doc = pymupdf.open("some.pdf")
>>> page = doc[n]
>>> annot = page.first_annot
>>> page.rect
pymupdf.Rect(0.0, 0.0, 595.0, 842.0)
>>> annot.type
[5, 'Circle']
>>> del doc                       # or doc = None or doc.close()
>>> page.rect
<... omitted lines ...>
RuntimeError: orphaned object: parent is None
>>> annot.type
<... omitted lines ...>
RuntimeError: orphaned object: parent is None

.. note:: Objects outside the above relationship are not included in this mechanism. If you e.g. created a table of contents by *toc = doc.get_toc()*, and later close or change the document, then this cannot and does not change variable *toc* in any way. It is your responsibility to refresh such variables as required.

.. _FormXObject:

Design of Method :meth:`Page.show_pdf_page`
--------------------------------------------

Purpose and Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The method displays an image of a ("source") page of another PDF document within a specified rectangle of the current ("containing", "target") page.

* **In contrast** to :meth:`Page.insert_image`, this display is vector-based and hence remains accurate across zooming levels.
* **Just like** :meth:`Page.insert_image`, the size of the display is adjusted to the given rectangle.

The following variations of the display are currently supported:

* Bool parameter `"keep_proportion"` controls whether to maintain the aspect ratio (default) or not.
    * Rectangle parameter `"clip"` restricts the visible part of the source page rectangle. Default is the full page.
* float `"rotation"` rotates the display by an arbitrary angle (degrees). If the angle is not an integer multiple of 90, only 2 of the 4 corners may be positioned on the target border if also `"keep_proportion"` is true.
* Bool parameter `"overlay"` controls whether to put the image on top (foreground, default) of current page content or not (background).

Use cases include (but are not limited to) the following:

1. "Stamp" a series of pages of the current document with the same image, like a company logo or a watermark.
2. Combine arbitrary input pages into one output page to support “booklet” or double-sided printing (known as "4-up", "n-up").
3. Split up (large) input pages into several arbitrary pieces. This is also called “posterization”, because you e.g. can split an A4 page horizontally and vertically, print the 4 pieces enlarged to separate A4 pages, and end up with an A2 version of your original page.

Technical Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is done using PDF **"Form XObjects"**, see section 8.10 on page 217 of :ref:`AdobeManual`. On execution of a :meth:`Page.show_pdf_page`, the following things happen:

    1. The :data:`resources` and :data:`contents` objects of source page in source document are copied over to the target document, jointly creating a new **Form XObject** with the following properties. The PDF :data:`xref` number of this object is returned by the method.

        a. `/BBox` equals `/Mediabox` of the source page
        b. `/Matrix` equals the identity matrix.
        c. `/Resources` equals that of the source page. This involves a “deep-copy” of hierarchically nested other objects (including fonts, images, etc.). The complexity involved here is covered by MuPDF's grafting [#f1]_ technique functions.
        d. This is a stream object type, and its stream is an exact copy of the combined data of the source page's :data:`contents` objects.

        This Form XObject is only executed once per shown source page. Subsequent displays of the same source page will skip this step and only create "pointer" Form XObjects (done in next step) to this object.

    2. A second **Form XObject** is then created which the target page uses to invoke the display. This object has the following properties:

        a. `/BBox` equals the `/CropBox` of the source page (or `"clip"`).
        b. `/Matrix` represents the mapping of `/BBox` to the target rectangle.
        c. `/XObject` references the previous Form XObject via the fixed name `fullpage`.
        d. The stream of this object contains exactly one fixed statement: `/fullpage Do`.
        e. If the method's `"oc"` argument is given, its value is assigned to this Form XObject as `/OC`.

    3. The :data:`resources` and :data:`contents` objects of the target page are now modified as follows.

        a. Add an entry to the `/XObject` dictionary of `/Resources` with the name `fzFrm<n>` (with n chosen such that this entry is unique on the page).
        b. Depending on `"overlay"`, prepend or append a new object to the page's `/Contents` array, containing the statement `q /fzFrm<n> Do Q`.

This design approach ensures that:

1. The (potentially large) source page is only copied once to the target PDF. Only small "pointer" Form XObjects objects are created per each target page to show the source page.
2. Each referring target page can have its own `"oc"` parameter to control the source page's visibility individually.



.. _RedirectMessages:

Diagnostics
----------------------------

.. _Messages:

|PyMuPDF| messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|PyMuPDF| has a Message system for showing text diagnostics.

By default messages are written to `sys.stdout`. This can be controlled in
two ways:

*
  Set environment variable `PYMUPDF_MESSAGE` before |PyMuPDF| is imported.

*
  Call `set_messages()`:


MuPDF errors and warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MuPDF generates text errors and warnings.

*
  These errors and warnings are appended to an internal list, accessible with
  `Tools.mupdf_warnings()`. Also see `Tools.reset_mupdf_warnings()`.

*
  By default these errors and warnings are also sent to the |PyMuPDF| message
  system.
  
  * This can be controlled with `mupdf_display_errors()` and
    `mupdf_display_warnings()`.
  
  *
    These messages are prefixed with `MuPDF error: ` and `MuPDF warning: `
    respectively.
  
Some MuPDF errors may lead to Python exceptions.

Example output for a **recoverable error**. We are opening a damaged PDF, but MuPDF is able to repair it and gives us a little information on what happened. Then we illustrate how to find out whether the document can later be saved incrementally. Checking the :attr:`Document.is_dirty` attribute at this point also indicates that during `pymupdf.open` the document had to be repaired:

>>> import pymupdf
>>> doc = pymupdf.open("damaged-file.pdf")  # leads to a sys.stderr message:
mupdf: cannot find startxref
>>> print(pymupdf.TOOLS.mupdf_warnings())  # check if there is more info:
cannot find startxref
trying to repair broken xref
repairing PDF document
object missing 'endobj' token
>>> doc.can_save_incrementally()  # this is to be expected:
False
>>> # the following indicates whether there are updates so far
>>> # this is the case because of the repair actions:
>>> doc.is_dirty
True
>>> # the document has nevertheless been created:
>>> doc
pymupdf.Document('damaged-file.pdf')
>>> # we now know that any save must occur to a new file

Example output for an **unrecoverable error**:

>>> import pymupdf
>>> doc = pymupdf.open("does-not-exist.pdf")
mupdf: cannot open does-not-exist.pdf: No such file or directory
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#1>", line 1, in <module>
    doc = pymupdf.open("does-not-exist.pdf")
  File "C:\Users\Jorj\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\lib\site-packages\fitz\pymupdf.py", line 2200, in __init__
    _pymupdf.Document_swiginit(self, _pymupdf.new_Document(filename, stream, filetype, rect, width, height, fontsize))
RuntimeError: cannot open does-not-exist.pdf: No such file or directory
>>>



.. _Coordinates:

Coordinates
--------------------------------------------


This is one of the most frequently used terms in this documentation. A **coordinate** generally means a pair of numbers `(x, y)` referring to some location, like a corner of a rectangle (:ref:`Rect`), a :ref:`Point` and so forth. The two values usually are floats, but there a objects like images which only allow them to be integers.

To actually *find* a coordinate's location, we also need to know the *reference* point for ``x`` and ``y`` - in other words, we must know where location `(0, 0)` is positioned. Once `(0, 0)` (the "origin") is known, we speak of a "coordinate system".

Several coordinate systems exist in document processing. For instance, the coordinate systems of a PDF page and the image created from it are **different**. We therefore need ways to *transform* coordinates from one system to another (and also back occasionally). This is the task of a :ref:`Matrix`. It is a mathematical function which works much like a factor that can be "multiplied" with a point or rectangle to give us the corresponding point / rectangle in another coordinate system. The inverse of a transformation matrix can be used to revert the transformation. Much like multiplying by some factor, say 3, can be reverted by dividing the result by 3 (or multiplying it with 1/3).

Coordinates and Images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Images have a coordinate system with integer coordinates. Origin `(0, 0)` is the top-left point. ``x`` values must be in `range(width)`, and ``y`` values in `range(height)`. Therefore, ``y`` values *increase* if we go *downwards*. For every image, there is only a **finite number** of coordinates, namely `width * height`. A location in an image is also called a "pixel".

- How **large** an image will be (in centimeters or inches) when e.g. printed, depends on additional information: the "resolution". This is measured in **DPI** (dots per inch, or pixels per inch). To find the printed size of some image, we therefore must divide its width and its height by the corresponding DPI values (there may separate ones for width and for height) and will get the respective number of inches.


Origin Point, Point Size and Y-Axis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In **PDF**, the origin `(0, 0)` of a page is located at its **bottom-left point**. In **MuPDF**, the origin `(0, 0)` of a page is located at its **top-left point**.


.. image:: images/img-coordinate-space.png

Coordinates are float numbers and measured in **points**, where:

- **one point equals 1/72 inches**.

Typical document page sizes are **ISO A4** and **Letter**. A **Letter** page has a size of **8.5 x 11 inches**, corresponding to **612 x 792 points**. In the **PDF** coordinate system, the top-left point of a **Letter** page hence has the coordinate `(0, 792)` as **the y-axis points upwards**. Now we know our document size the **MuPDF** coordinate system for the bottom right would be coordinate `(612, 792)` (and for **PDF** this coordinate would then be `(612,0)`).

- Theoretically, there are **infinitely many** coordinate positions on a **PDF** page. In practice however, at most the first 5 decimal places are sufficient for a reasonable precision.


- In **MuPDF**, multiple document formats are supported - **PDF** just being one among **over a dozen others**. Images are also supported as documents in **MuPDF** (therefore having one page usually). This is one of the reasons why **MuPDF** uses a coordinate system with the origin `(0, 0)` being the **top-left** point of any document page. **The y-axis points downwards**, like with images. Coordinates in **MuPDF** in any case are floats, like in **PDF**.

- A rectangle `Rect(0, 0, 100, 100)` for instance in **MuPDF** (and thus **PyMuPDF**) therefore is a square with edges of length 100 points (= 1.39 inches or 3.53 centimeters). Its top-left corner is the origin. To switch between the two coordinate systems **PDF** to **MuPDF**, every :ref:`Page` object has a :attr:`Page.transformation_matrix`. Its inverse can be used to compute a rectangle's PDF coordinates. In this way we can conveniently find that `Rect(0, 0, 100, 100)` in **MuPDF** is the same as `Rect(0, 692, 100, 792)` in **PDF**. See this code snippet::

    >>> page = doc.new_page(width=612, height=792)  # make new Letter page
    >>> ptm = page.transformation_matrix
    >>> # the inverse matrix of ptm is ~ptm
    >>> pymupdf.Rect(0, 0, 100, 100) * ~ptm
    Rect(0.0, 692.0, 100.0, 792.0)



.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] MuPDF supports "deep-copying" objects between PDF documents. To avoid duplicate data in the target, it uses so-called "graftmaps", like a form of scratchpad: for each object to be copied, its :data:`xref` number is looked up in the graftmap. If found, copying is skipped. Otherwise, the new :data:`xref` is recorded and the copy takes place. PyMuPDF makes use of this technique in two places so far: :meth:`Document.insert_pdf` and :meth:`Page.show_pdf_page`. This process is fast and very efficient, because it prevents multiple copies of typically large and frequently referenced data, like images and fonts. However, you may still want to consider using garbage collection (option 4) in any of the following cases:

    1. The target PDF is not new / empty: grafting does not check for resources that already existed (e.g. images, fonts) in the target document before opening it.
    2. Using :meth:`Page.show_pdf_page` for more than one source document: each grafting occurs **within one source** PDF only, not across multiple. So if e.g. the same image exists in pages from different source PDFs, then this will not be detected until garbage collection.
