"The fabulous GUI package `wxPython <https://wxpython.org/>`_ has a "
"database of over 540 predefined RGB colors, which are given more or less "
"memorizable names. Among them are not only standard names like \"green\" "
"or \"blue\", but also \"turquoise\", \"skyblue\", and 100 (not only 50 "
"...) shades of \"gray\", etc."

"We have taken the liberty to copy this database (a list of tuples) "
"modified into PyMuPDF and make its colors available as PDF compatible "
"float triples: for wxPython's *(\"WHITE\", 255, 255, 255)* we return *(1,"
" 1, 1)*, which can be directly used in *color* and *fill* parameters. We "
"also accept any mixed case of \"wHiTe\" to find a color."

"If you want to actually see how the many available colors look like, use "
"scripts `print by RGB <https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF-"
"Utilities/blob/master/examples/print-rgb/print.py>`_ or `print by HSV "
"<https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF-Utilities/blob/master/examples/print-"
"hsv/print.py>`_ in the examples directory. They create PDFs (already "
"existing in the same directory) with all these colors. Their only "
"difference is sorting order: one takes the RGB values, the other one the "
"Hue-Saturation-Values as sort criteria. This is a screen print of what "
"these files look like."
