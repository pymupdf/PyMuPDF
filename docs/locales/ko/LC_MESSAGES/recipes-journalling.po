"Journalling is a logging mechanism which permits either **reverting** or "
"**re-applying** changes to a PDF. Similar to LUWs \"Logical Units of "
"Work\" in modern database systems, one can group a set of updates into an"
" \"operation\". In MuPDF journalling, an operation plays the role of a "
"LUW."

msgid ""
"In contrast to LUW implementations found in database systems, MuPDF "
"journalling happens on a **per document level**. There is no support for "
"simultaneous updates across multiple PDFs: one would have to establish "
"one's own logic here."

"Once enabled, every change must happen inside an *operation* -- otherwise"
" an exception is raised. An operation is started and stopped via document"
" methods. Updates happening between these two calls form an LUW and can "
"thus collectively be rolled back or re-applied, or, in MuPDF terminology "
"\"undone\" resp. \"redone\"."

"For an **existing** PDF being journalled, a special new save method is "
"available: :meth:`Document.save_snapshot`. This performs a special "
"incremental save that includes all journalled updates so far. If its "
"journal is saved at the same time (immediately after the document "
"snapshot), then document and journal are in sync and can later on be used"
" together to undo or redo operations or to continue journalled updates --"
" just as if there had been no interruption."

"Snapshot files are structured like incremental updates. Nevertheless, the"
" internal journalling logic requires, that saving **must happen to a new "
"file**. So the user should develop a file naming convention to support "
"recognizable relationships between an original PDF, like `original.pdf` "
"and its snapshot sets, like `original-snap1.pdf` / `original-snap1.log`, "
"`original-snap2.pdf` / `original-snap2.log`, etc."
