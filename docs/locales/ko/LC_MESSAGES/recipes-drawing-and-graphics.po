"|PyMuPDF| implements a large part of the available features via its "

"A shape is always created as a **child of a page**, usually with an "
"instruction like `shape = page.new_shape()`. The class defines numerous "
"methods that perform drawing operations on the page's area. For example, "
"`last_point = shape.draw_rect(rect)` draws a rectangle along the borders "
"of a suitably defined `rect = pymupdf.Rect(...)`."

"The returned *last_point* **always** is the :ref:`Point` where drawing "
"operation ended (\"last point\"). Every such elementary drawing requires "
"a subsequent :meth:`Shape.finish` to \"close\" it, but there may be "
"multiple drawings which have one common ``finish()`` method."
