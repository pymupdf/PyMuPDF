msgid ""
"The original naming convention for methods and properties has been "
"\"camelCase\". Since its creation around 2013, a tremendous increase of "
"functionality has happened in PyMuPDF -- and with it a corresponding "
"increase in classes, methods and properties. In too many cases, this has "
"led to non-intuitive, illogical and ugly names, difficult to memorize or "
"guess."

"A few versions ago, I therefore decided to shift gears and switch to a "
"\"snake_cased\" naming standard. This was a major effort, which needed a "
"step-wise approach. I think am done with it now (version 1.18.14)."

"The following list maps deprecated names to their new versions. For "
"example, property `pageCount` became `page_count` in the :ref:`Document` "
"class. There also are less obvious name changes, e.g. method `getPNGdata`"
" was renamed to `tobytes` in the :ref:`Pixmap` class."

"Old names will remain available as deprecated aliases through MuPDF "
"version 1.19.0 and **be removed** in the version that follows it - "
"probably version 1.20.0, but this depends on upstream decisions (MuPDF)."

"Starting with version 1.19.0, we will issue deprecation warnings on "
"`sys.stderr` like `Deprecation: 'newPage' removed from class 'Document' "
"after v1.19.0 - use 'new_page'.` when aliased methods are being used. "

"those of its subfolders are changed. Optionally, backups of the scripts "
