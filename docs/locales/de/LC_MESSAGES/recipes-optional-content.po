"*Optional Content* in PDF is a way to show or hide parts of a document "
"based on certain conditions: Parameters that can be set to ON or to OFF "

"This capability is useful in items such as CAD drawings, layered artwork,"
" maps, and multi-language documents. Typical uses include showing or "
"hiding details of complex vector graphics like geographical maps, "
"technical devices, architectural designs and similar, including "
"automatically switching between different zooming levels. Other use cases"
" may be to automatically show different detail levels when displaying a "
"document on screen as opposed to printing it."
