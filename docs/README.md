# PyMuPDF documentation

Welcome to the PyMuPDF documentation. This documentation relies on [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to publish HTML docs from markdown files written with [restructured text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) (RST).


## Sphinx version

This README assumes you have [Sphinx v5.0.2 installed](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) on your system.


## Updating the documentation

Within `docs` update the associated restructured text (`.rst`) files. These files represent the corresponding document pages. 

### Conventions

- Code parameters and referenced code objects should be referenced within backticks, not italics, double backtick is better for safety
- When referencing names of some of our products surround with | , e.g. |PyMuPDF| , not PyMuPDF, see `header.rst` for products names listing
- When hyperlinking, avoid inline hyperlinks and try to references link from common location at page bottom, also avoid the use of "here" or "click here" as this provides little information about the link content. e.g.

"`Click here <link>` for our Story class". Should be re-written to something more like "Find out more `on our Story class <link>`"

## Building HTML documentation

- Ensure you have the `furo` theme installed:

`pip install furo`

Furo theme, Copyright (c) 2020 Pradyun Gedam <mail@pradyunsg.me>, thank you to:

- From the "docs" location run:

`sphinx-build -b html . build/html`

This then creates the HTML documentation within `build/html`. 

> Use: `sphinx-build -a -b html . build/html` to build all, including the assets in `_static` (important if you have updated CSS).


### Using Sphinx Autobuild

A better way of building the documentation if you are actively working on updates is to run:

`sphinx-autobuild . _build/html`

This will serve the docs on a localhost and auto-update the pages live as you make edits.

### Building the Japanese documentation

- From the "docs" location run:

`sphinx-build -a -b html -D language=ja . _build/html/ja`


- Updating, after changes on the `main` branch and a sync with the main `en` .rst files, from the "docs" location, do:

`sphinx-build -b gettext . _build/gettext`

then:

`sphinx-intl update -p _build/gettext -l ja`

This will update the corresponding `po` files for further edits. Then check these files for "#, fuzzy" entries as the new stuff might exist there and requires editing.


## Building PDF documentation

- First ensure you have [rst2pdf](https://pypi.org/project/rst2pdf/) installed:

`python -m pip install rst2pdf`

- Then run:

`sphinx-build -b pdf . build/pdf`

This will then generate a single PDF for all of the documentation within `build/pdf`.
