This documentation covers **PyMuPDF v1.24.13** features as of **2024-10-29 00:00:01**.

The major and minor versions of **PyMuPDF** and **MuPDF** will always be the same. Only the third qualifier (patch level) may deviate from that of **MuPDF**.

Typically PyMuPDF is released more frequently than MuPDF so it will often be
the case that the patch level of PyMuPDF will be greater than the embedded
MuPDF.

For example PyMuPDF-1.24.5 contains MuPDF-1.24.2.

Also see `pymupdf_version` and `mupdf_version`.
