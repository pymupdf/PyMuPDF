No significant gamma-ray excess above the expected background
is detected from the direction of FRB 20171019A, with 52 gamma
candidate events from the source region and 524 background event.
A second analysis using an independent event calibration and reconstruction (Parsons & Hinton 2014) confirms this result. A search for
variable emission on timescales ranging from milliseconds to several minutes with tools provided in (Brun et al. 2020) does not reveal
any variability above 2.2 𝜎. For the total data set of 1.8 h, 95% confidence level (C. L.) upper limits on the photon flux are derived using
the method described by Rolke et al. (2005). The energy threshold
of the data is highly dependent on the zenith angle of the observations. For these observations, the zenith angles range from 15 to 25
deg, which leads to an energy threshold for the stacked data set of
𝐸th = 120 GeV. The upper limit on the Very High Energy (VHE)
