      # It seems to be important not to install a custom python here,
      # because `sudo` (which we need to use when installing to /usr/local
      # etc) always ends up running the default python, even if we set
      # $PATH etc. So for example we can end up with mupdf files and
      # pymupdf files being installed into .../python3.11/site-packages and
      # .../python3.10/site-packages, and tests all fail to import fitz.
